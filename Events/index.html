    <!-- 
    We have the ability to create dynamic web pages by using events. Events are actions that can be detected by your Web Application.
    All the different visitor's actions that a web page can respond to are called events.
    An event represents the precise moment when something happens.
    Examples:
    moving a mouse over an element
    selecting a radio button
    clicking on an element
    The term "fires/fired" is often used with events. Example: "The keypress event is fired, the moment you press a key".
    When these events are triggered, you can then use a custom function to do pretty much whatever you want with the event. These custom functions call Event Handlers. -->
